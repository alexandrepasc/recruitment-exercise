# recruitment-exercise

## Introduction

This is my second project playing with ReactJS, so the code is not as pretty as it should be. The first project it was following a tutorial for the Tic Tac Toe in the react page.

The idea of this project is to have an exercise that could be used in the of new candidates for a team of Quality Assurance.

With this project we have a register form for a new user that has some issues. The idea is to find the issues report them and set the priority for each issue.

Those issues could be improvements or bugs.

## Execution

- Start the application (run in the project root folder)

    `npm start`

- Install the project packages (run in the project root folder)

    `npm install`

- Create project (run in your work space, it will create a folder with the app name)

    `npx create-react-app app-name`
